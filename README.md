# Face To Parameter (Portfolio Repository)
## Project Description
This project was initiated at a company with the aim of predicting parameters using real human face pictures. The core idea is to leverage facial recognition technology to analyze human faces and predict various parameters, potentially useful in fields like personalized recommendations, security systems, or user interaction enhancement.

## Requirements
The project relies on several key Python libraries. Ensure you have the following installed:
- torch: For deep learning operations.
- pytorch-lightning: To simplify training and testing of PyTorch models.
- opencv-python: For image processing and face recognition tasks.

You can install these requirements directly using the command below:
```bash
pip install torch pytorch-lightning opencv-python
```

## Data
- FFHQ
- PersonAI Cartoon Dataset
- Label files encoded by FaceNet

## Model Training and Prediction
```python
python train.py
```
