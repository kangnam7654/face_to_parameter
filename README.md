# Face To Parameter (Portfolio Repository)
## Project Description
This project was initiated at a company with the aim of predicting parameters using real human face pictures. The core idea is to leverage facial recognition technology to analyze human faces and predict various parameters, potentially useful in fields like personalized recommendations, security systems, or user interaction enhancement.

## Requirements
The project relies on several key Python libraries. Ensure you have the following installed:
- torch: For deep learning operations.
- pytorch-lightning: To simplify training and testing of PyTorch models.
- opencv-python: For image processing and face recognition tasks.

You can install these requirements directly using the command below:
```bash
pip install torch pytorch-lightning opencv-python
```

## Installation
To set up the project, run the following command:
```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Data
The project utilizes real human face images. For privacy and ethical reasons, the actual dataset used is not publicly shared. However, a sample dataset can be generated using.

The dataset should follow this format:
- Each image file should be named with a unique identifier.
- Associated parameters for each face should be stored in a separate file, preferably in CSV format.

## Model Training and Prediction
The project uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for facial recognition and parameter prediction. Training details, including hyperparameters and training procedure, are documented in `training_documentation.md`.
